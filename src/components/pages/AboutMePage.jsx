                    I am a full Stack website developer with three years of experience in HTML and CSS, as well as one year of experience in javascript. I earned a full stack website development certificate in February of 2024, and I've used these skills continuously in my work.

                    I am also a freelance artist, and I take that knowledge of color theory and creativity with me into the computer science field.
